  "summary": "The diff implements all six requirements of the stock request system. REQ-1 (StockRequestsPage with form and 23 locations), REQ-2 (backend Motoko data structures and methods), REQ-3 (React Query hooks), REQ-4 (kanban dashboard with drag-and-drop and manual status change), REQ-5 (archive page with table and back-link), and REQ-6 (routing and sidebar) all appear implemented. The StockRequest type uses 'notes' instead of 'comment' as the field name, but this is a minor naming variation. No significant hallucinations or missing requirements detected.",
