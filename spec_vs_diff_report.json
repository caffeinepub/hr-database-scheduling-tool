  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/index.css to add global CSS rules targeting Radix UI/shadcn overlay surfaces (dialogs, dropdowns, selects, popovers, tooltips) with fully opaque background-color declarations using CSS variables from the existing theme. The fix is applied globally via CSS so all current and future overlays benefit. The backdrop/scrim is intentionally excluded. The visual theme (red/white/black palette) is preserved. This directly addresses REQ-1 and its acceptance criteria.",
