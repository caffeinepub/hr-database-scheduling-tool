      "featureTitle": "Restyle the entire application with a bold red, white, and black colour scheme that fits an Escape Room brand. Replace the current plain monochrome palette with a rich theme: use deep/vivid reds as primary accent colours, clean white for content surfaces, and black/near-black for backgrounds and sidebars. Apply this consistently across the header, sidebar, navigation items, buttons, badges, stat cards, page backgrounds, tables, and form controls. Typography and iconography should also reflect this palette. The result should feel immersive and on-brand — energetic but readable.",

This tab should display all badges currently assigned to the employee as visual badge cards — each showing the badge emoji, name, description, category colour chip, date assigned, assigning manager's name, and optional note. When the viewer is a manager or admin, show an 'Assign Badge' button that opens a modal (`AssignBadgeModal`) allowing them to select a badge from the full badge list (grouped by category), optionally add a note, and confirm the assignment. Managers/admins should also be able to remove an assigned badge via a remove button on each badge card.
